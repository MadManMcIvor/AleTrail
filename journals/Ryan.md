* Provided continuity between all three files of db.py, beers.py and breweries sql
* Encountered another issue where, upon getting a list of beers, all required fields respond with validation errors. -_-

## 10/12/22
* Created a post router and query for beers.
* Ran into a table issue, and spent some time with an instructor solving this issue
* Much pain later, the issue has been resolved. One can now simply post a beer
* The beer models, tables, and the db.py file all need to be consistent. I need to add a few properties

## 10/11/22
* Created the model for BeerIn and BeerOut
* Created a router to get a list of beers
* Created some beer queries for getting the list as well as a detail query

## 10/4/22
* Reworked our APIs Doc as a team to reflect a re-scoped MVP - we're switching to just breweries, beers, favorites, and users. Making reviews a stretch goal if we can get to it
* We each created our own issues to get us started and figure out our roles. I'm taking the React/frontend side of the project to start
* We got the main project up to speed so everyone can create test branches with a base layout set
