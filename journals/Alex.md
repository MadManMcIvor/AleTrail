* We figured out how to make merge requests and implemented a few of those.
* Fixed the beers carousels
* Added modals for both beers and breweries

## 10/11/22
* Imported the react-bootstrap library and got the masonry to work on the breweries page.
* Imported a react-carousel library and created some of the components for the beers page. I've mostly got it working but I'm still tweaking it though. 

## 10/10/22
* Transformed the existing "under construction" React into the skeleton for our project. Played with a few different attempts to make masonry work on the breweries page"

## 10/6/22
* Created the tables and dummy data for breweries and beers with Justin. Did some live share for the first time. Also, got Beekeeper up and running.

## 10/5/22
* We decided on using PostgreSQL as our database as opposed to MongoDB
* We worked as a team to get our docker compose file up and working for local development.
* Started to create a data file so we can create the tables and some dummy data for the end points to grab when we dive into them

## 10/4/22
* Reworked our APIs Doc as a team to reflect a re-scope MVP - we're just going to do breweries, beers, favorites, and users. Making reviews a stretch goal if we can get to it.
* We each created our own issues to get us started and figure out our roles. I'm taking the React/frontend side of the project to start
* We got the main project up to speed so everyone can create branches with all of the technical nitty gritty up to date.
