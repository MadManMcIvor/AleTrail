## 10/5/22
* We decided on using PostgreSQL as our database as opposed to MongoDB
* We worked as a team to get our docker compose file up and working for local development.
* Started to create a data file so we can create the tables and some dummy data for the end points to grab when we dive into them

## 10/4/22
* Reworked our APIs Doc as a team to reflect a re-scope MVP - we're just going to do breweries, beers, favorites, and users. Making reviews a stretch goal if we can get to it.
* We each created our own issues to get us started and figure out our roles. I'm taking the React/frontend side of the project to start
* We got the main project up to speed so everyone can create branches with all of the technical nitty gritty up to date.
