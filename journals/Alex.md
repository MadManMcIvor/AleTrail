## 10/19/22 
* Finished creating end points for beer and brewery favorites (create, delete, view favorites by user)

## 10/18/22
* We fixed the pop up for the signup page error modal.
* Made the logout modal actually log the user out and redirect them afterwards.
* Started working on the favorites FastAPI ends points

## 10/17/22
* Pair programmed with Julie all day. We set up the signup page, the login page, and the logout page on the front end. We made modals for the logout, and error messages when attempting to login or signup. It took a long time to figure out how to integrate the features, but feels like we're in a good place now.

## 10/14/22
* Linked up the brewery list API to the front-end and deleted the dummy data.

## 10/13/22
* Worked on the Navbar today. I switched it over to a react-bootstrap component rather than just the regular bootstrap how it was. I also added our logo and switched it be white. It took quite a while to figure out why the image wouldn't display for the logo. Turns out React gives it problems so I had to wrap it in a 'required' function.

## 10/12/22
* We figured out how to make merge requests and implemented a few of those.
* Fixed the beers carousels
* Added modals for both beers and breweries

## 10/11/22
* Imported the react-bootstrap library and got the masonry to work on the breweries page.
* Imported a react-carousel library and created some of the components for the beers page. I've mostly got it working but I'm still tweaking it though. 

## 10/10/22
* Transformed the existing "under construction" React into the skeleton for our project. Played with a few different attempts to make masonry work on the breweries page"

## 10/6/22
* Created the tables and dummy data for breweries and beers with Justin. Did some live share for the first time. Also, got Beekeeper up and running.

## 10/5/22
* We decided on using PostgreSQL as our database as opposed to MongoDB
* We worked as a team to get our docker compose file up and working for local development.
* Started to create a data file so we can create the tables and some dummy data for the end points to grab when we dive into them

## 10/4/22
* Reworked our APIs Doc as a team to reflect a re-scope MVP - we're just going to do breweries, beers, favorites, and users. Making reviews a stretch goal if we can get to it.
* We each created our own issues to get us started and figure out our roles. I'm taking the React/frontend side of the project to start
* We got the main project up to speed so everyone can create branches with all of the technical nitty gritty up to date.
