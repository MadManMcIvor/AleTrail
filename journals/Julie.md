Today I created a signing key and continued to make corrections on the users endpoint because after adding the authentication, the swagger endpoints didn't work correctly. 

## 10/10/22 
The endpoints for users CRUD works, but I need to include password. Today I continued working on my endpoints and made changes to the table to include password, is_admin, and is_brewery_owner. After the changes to the table, I can focus on authentication and testing out all the endpoint requests.  

## 10/6/22 
Today we tested our data in our database and set up beekeeper. I continued working on users routers and queries. Made changes to the user database. I'm going to read the docs/ watch video on authentication. 

## 10/5/22
Today we made changes to the docker-compose.yaml files so we can work on local development. We decided that we want to use PostgreSql for our database and have pgAdmin setup. We worked on creating some database so we can test locally. 

## 10/4/22
We finished drafting our API endpoints and re-evaluate our MVP and made changes to have some features as stretch goals. We decided to have brewery, beers, favorites, and users as our MVP. Reviews as a stretch goal. We divided tasks for each member and wrote issues on gitlab. I decided to work on the users endpoints. 

## 10/3/22
* We continued working on the API endpoints and discussed the possible href and what to include for each CRUD view. Heroku site is running and shows under construction. 

## 9/30/22
* We asked for about pipeline failed and clarification on issues and whether the issue is for each page or each feature of the page. We haven't decide on what database to use. Postgre, SQL, or MongoDB. We saw the exploration is going to be on FASTAPI and SQL and decided we can think about it over the weekend. 

## 9/29/22
* We worked on endpoints and decided on the response shape 
* Cloned project and we followed the directions on live channel for deploying the project. We're weren't sure about step 2 Heroku Variables: CORS_HOST so we asked a SEIR for help.

## 9/28/22
* We continued working on the wireframe and discussed what to include in the MVP.Authentication, brewery list page with detail card, beer list page with detail cards, and user profile page with list view of their favorite breweries and beers. Stretch Goals: add a brewery request form, add a beer request form, add a map that displays breweries and distance from them, add a taste profile to recommend beers, and add challenges and badges to user profiles.

## 9/27/22 
* We worked on wireframe for our app using excalidraw. We discussed what features and designs we want on the webpage. We also decided AleTrail going to be our group name.

## 9/26/22
* We discussed what our project is going to be. In the end we decided on a brewery app where people can see a list of brewery in their city and keep track of their favorite drinks.
